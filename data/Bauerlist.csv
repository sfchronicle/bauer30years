1986,Sushi Ran,"Long before sushi was available in just about every neighborhood, Yoshi Tome opened this Sausalito restaurant, and it remains one of the best in the Bay Area. Much of the recent boom in Japanese restaurants ‚Äî especially ones with upscale omakase menus ‚Äî can be traced back to him, including Kusakabe, Ju-ni and Village Sake in Fairfax.",China Moon,"Barbara Tropp fell in love with Chinese culture, which led to doctoral studies at Princeton and a definitive book: ‚ÄúThe Modern Art of Chinese Cooking.‚Äù Her restaurant gave a fresh, authentic face to Chinese food with a Chez Panisse-like focus on sourcing, which was unheard of in other Asian restaurants. The restaurant closed in 1997; Tropp died in 2001.",,,http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/60/10918958/5/,Brant Ward / The Chronicle,Sushi Ran in Sausalito
1987,Zuni CafÈ,"While the restaurant opened in 1979 with Southwestern and Mexican food, it wasn't until Judy Rodgers' 1987 arrival that Zuni took a shift toward the Euro-centric menu it still has. Rodgers launched a national phenomenon by adding a wood-burning brick oven and producing a roast chicken that has shown up on menus from coast to coast. Today the restaurant thrives under Rebecca Boice, who worked with Rodgers from 2002 to 2012, returning to Zuni after Rodgers' death in 2013. This restaurant, which won the James Beard Award for Outstanding Restaurant in America, truly defines the San Francisco sensibility.",,,,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/45/32/10901149/7/,Brant Ward / The Chronicle,Zuni CafÈ in San Francisco (1984)
1988,L'Avenue,"Nancy Oakes began producing elevated comfort food in Pat O'Shea's, a dive bar in the Richmond where patrons also played darts, shot pool and watched sports. This unlikely venue ‚Äî a pop-up before the concept was trendy ‚Äî led to the opening of L'Avenue, where she took American food to a new level: grilled salmon with chive sauce, sauteed spinach, corn sticks, zucchini, pears and tomatoes; or veal chops with Italian-inspired salsa and new potatoes sprinkled with sage and Parmesan and served with French beans tossed with lemon olive oil and roasted peppers. Oakes closed the restaurant in 1993 when she opened Boulevard, which remains the pinnacle of inventive American cooking.",Oritalia/Bix,"Blending Italian and Asian influences in a small-plate format, Oritalia was a beacon for the upcoming fusion trend. And no other restaurant bridges eras as completely as Bix; the classic bar, live nightly entertainment and potato pillows with caviar are timeless.",,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/61/10918993/5/,Michael Maloney / The Chronicle,L'Avenue in San Francisco
1989,Acquerello,"When fine dining still meant French, Suzette Gresham and Giancarlo Paterlini opened this white tablecloth Italian restaurant on Sacramento Street, giving an upscale twist to soulful dishes. As the dining scene became more casual and many high-end restaurants began to close, Acquerello kept getting better. It was also one of the first places to delve deeply into Italian wines.",Postrio,"The rivalry between North and South declared a truce when Wolfgang Puck opened this impressive see-and-be-seen restaurant on Post Street, where a ground-level stairway led down to the main dining room and the focal point was an original Robert Rauschenberg worth at least $1 million. While the cooking had a Northern California sensibility, the glitz boosted our lagging dining scene and was a harbinger of some grand restaurants to come.",,,http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/50/65/10915166/5/,Liz Hafalia / The Chronicle,Acquerello in San Francisco
1990,O Chame,"The Loma Prieta earthquake in October 1989 shook up the dining scene and derailed much of the momentum that had been building. David Vardy was a trailblazer, using pristine California ingredients and kaiseki principles. He first opened a tea shop called Daruma, whose tea cakes were so good he exported them to Japan. This led to O Chame on Fourth Street in Berkeley. The restaurant closed in 2013 and is now home to Iyasare, where Shotaro Kamio offers his own innovative brand of Japanese food.",Flying Saucer,Albert Tordjman pioneered an area in the Mission (Guerrero and 22nd) and featured a wildly eclectic menu that borrowed from many cultures. He became one of the first high-profile chefs (he had previously worked at Auberge du Soleil in St. Helena) to offer white-tablecloth-caliber food in casual surroundings.,,,http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/45/32/10901151/7/,Steve Ringman / The Chronicle,O Chame in Berkeley
1991,Slow Club,"Not only did this restaurant lay claim to an undiscovered area of San Francisco ‚Äî the neighborhood between the Mission and Potrero Hill, at Mariposa and Hampshire streets ‚Äî but it also was the first trendy restaurant to embrace an industrial decor. The postage-stamp-sized kitchen was carved out of one side of the room, and a bar lit up the back. The restaurant closed last year and is slated to reopen as a new restaurant, named the Morris.",Aqua,"This restaurant, which launched the career of Michael Mina, featured high ceilings, soft lighting, impressive six-foot tall flower arrangements and innovative seafood preparations. While elegant, Aqua was less formal and more fun that other four-star restaurants. Today it is Michael Mina, and it remains one of the most beautiful restaurants in the city. The tuna tartare with Asian flavors, pioneered by chef George Morrone, is still on the menu.",,,http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/45/33/10901230/5/,Chris Stewart / The Chronicle,Slow Club in San Francisco
1992,Esperpento,"More than a decade before the Bay Area fell in love with Spanish food, Carlos Muela and his family opened this tapas bar in the Mission. While the food at other Spanish restaurants may surpass it today, the restaurant is still going strong. The family has another distinction: Son Carlos is the founder of SoMa StrEat Food Park and Spark Social, which have both become hubs for food trucks.",,,,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/52/05/10920273/5/,Michael Maloney / The Chronicle,Esperpento in San Francisco
1993,Lulu,"Few restaurants have been the harbinger of so many trends as Lulu. Located on Folsom and Fourth streets in a sleekly designed warehouse, Lulu lured locals to what was then a desolate area. Chef-owner Reed Hearon was one of the first to feature a communal table (though it was always empty) and family-style dishes meant to share (many customers thought it was weird). The wood oven in the center of the dining room was another innovation, and cooks manning the fire wore headsets to communicate with the staff in the kitchen.",Alain Rondelli,"Before most people had heard of molecular gastronomy, Rondelli was placing shrimp and gnocchi under a frothy lime emulsion. He was a master at whimsical touches: serving calamari in a martini glass on clear tomato gelee with carrot juice poured tableside and giving diners cotton candy as they paid their check. He closed in 1998; the space is now Chapeau.",,,http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/52/05/10920272/3/,Christina Koci Hernandez / The Chronicle,Lulu in San Francisco
1994,French Laundry,"The French Laundry represents the most significant chef takeover I've seen. The restaurant already had a solid reputation under prior owners Don and Sally Schmitt, but Thomas Keller almost single-handedly put Yountville on the culinary map. Once there, Keller created a magical destination on par with the finest country restaurants in France. In fact, the restaurant has repeatedly been named one of the best in the world. His whimsical approach to food ‚Äî salmon tartare cones or ‚Äúcoffee and doughnuts‚Äù (semifreddo in a demitasse and doughnut holes) ‚Äî has been copied worldwide.",Rubicon,"Drew Nieporent, now best known for Batard and Nobu, came from New York to open this impressive restaurant where Wayfare Tavern now resides. Few kitchens have turned out as many stars: Traci Des Jardins (Jardiniere), Chris Cosentino (Cockscomb), Robbie Lewis (The Commissary), Richard Reddington (Redd), Dennis Leary (Canteen), Jeremy Fox (Ubuntu and L.A.'s Rustic Canyon) and ‚Äî the final chefs before it closed in 2008 ‚Äî Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski (State Bird Provisions). It was equally important in the wine world, with such heavyweights as Larry Stone, Rajat Parr and Alan Murray.",,,http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/50/66/10915247/5/,Lance Iversen / The Chronicle,The French Laundry in Yountville 
1995,Slanted Door,"Charles Phan had more impact on Vietnamese food than any other chef in the country, which is why the Slanted Door was named Outstanding Restaurant in America by the James Beard Foundation in 2014. Phan and his family started the restaurant in the Mission in 1995 and eventually settled at the Ferry Building in 2004. The restaurant was also one of the first Asian restaurants to create a serious wine list and bar program using organic ingredients.",Betelnut/42 Degrees,"Betelnut gave integrity to the spiraling fusion trend. Designed to look like a 1930s Shanghai speakeasy, it swept the continent, with dishes from Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia and, most importantly, China. 42 Degrees became the model for sophisticated warehouse decor and late-night dining At most restaurants, prime-time dining was at 7 p.m.; here, that's when the doors opened.",,,http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/52/05/10920292/3/,Russell Yip / The Chronicle,Slanted Door in San Francisco
1996,Rose Pistola,"North Beach, one of the most interesting walking neighborhoods in San Francisco, wasn't known for great food until Reed Hearon opened this restaurant on Columbus Avenue. At that time, most Italian restaurants offered a greatest-hits menu, but Hearon focused on the specialties of the Ligurian region. His kitchen was equipped with a wood-burning oven, rotisserie and two separate grills, turning out pizza, whole roast fish, cast iron pots of polenta and other dishes that made it the best Italian restaurant of its era. The year after it opened the James Beard Foundation named it the Best New Restaurant. While its trendiness has diminished over the years, Rose Pistola is still one of the better draws to the area.",,,,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/62/10919065/5/,Chris Stewart / The Chronicle,"Rose Pistola is surrounded by friends as she sits at the table of honor at the 1996 opening of Rose Pistola in San Francisco.
"
1997,Chow,"Tony Gulisano had cooked at high-end restaurants, but he opened his first neighborhood place, near the Castro, with the idea that organic and sustainable dishes don't have to carry a high price tag. His menu features comfort food from around the world ‚Äî spaghetti and meatballs, Thai-style noodles, pizza, tuna melts, lamb burgers, chicken enchiladas. When he opened a branch in Lafayette in 2003, the restaurant also contained an organic produce market. He now has four locations, two in San Francisco and two in the East Bay.",Farallon/Jardiniere,"Pat Kuleto was the most influential restaurant designer of his era. After his successful partnership with Nancy Oakes at Boulevard, he continued to create grand spaces for high-profile chefs, including Traci Des Jardins at Jardiniere and Mark Franz at Farallon. He did the same in 2008 with Jan Birnbaum at Epic Roasthouse.",,,http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/62/10919082/7/,Kate Wade / The Chronicle,Chow's Lafayette location (2003)
1998,Asia SF,"Dinner and a drag show wasn't a new idea, but Asia SF was different. For one, at least in the early years, the food was excellent (ahi burgers with teriyaki glaze, duck quesadillas) and the surroundings were fun. More importantly, the restaurant/club helped to bring a misunderstood population into the mainstream. When they opened, owners Larry Hashbarger and Skip Young were quick to say the performers weren't transsexual (although some were) but ‚Äúgender illusionists.‚Äù Today, Asia SF's website proclaims that it is ‚Äúproud to bring this positive, trans-awareness experience to all guests.‚Äù The intersection of politics and food has always been a hallmark of San Francisco, and this is just one more example.",Delfina,"When Craig and Annie Stoll maxed out their credit cards to open this still superb Italian restaurant, they kick-started a new area of the Mission. This encouraged dozens of aspiring chefs to take a chance, turning the Mission into San Francisco's epicenter for innovative dining.",,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/52/16/10920833/5/,Liz Hafalia / The Chronicle,Asia SF in San Francisco
1999,Foreign Cinema,"No one had attempted to fund such an ambitious project in the Mission. At Foreign Cinema, John Varnedoe and his partners created a one-stop shop, with movies that played on the patio and a separate bar for pre- or post-dinner gatherings. While the place looked spectacular, the food floundered until 2001, when Gayle Pirie and John Clark took over and slowly turned it into one of the most popular restaurants in the city. They proved that great food can turn around what could have been an albatross, and, like Zuni Cafe, it's a restaurant that telescopes the San Francisco dining scene.",Gordon's House of Fine Eats,"Remember Multimedia Gulch? In the late ‚Äô90s it was the emerging tech center, and Gordon's was its epicenter. It closed in 2003, but it left a lasting legacy: With its large bar area and eclectic menu from chef-owner Gordon Drysdale (featuring fried chicken, Brussels sprout salad and pepperoni pizza) it became a blueprint for many restaurants that followed.",,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/63/10919129/3/,Carlos Avila Gonzalez / The Chronicle,Foreign Cinema in San Francisco
2000,Chez Nous,"This cramped 40-seat restaurant on Fillmore Street expanded the Spanish tapas idea to other cultures, offering small plates from around the world. Owner Pascal Rigo (best known for founding the Boulangerie chain) started a trend that was embraced all over the country. Chef Laurence Jossel was subsequently involved in both Chow and Nopa and has been at the center of many past and present trends. The restaurant closed in 2007 and became SPQR.",Bacar,"Building on what Drysdale did at Gordon's, this SoMa restaurant was the first place that not only was designed for the tech set but went after them as investors. With its sophisticated wine list and eclectic menu it was a solid hit, but it was shaken by the tech bust in 2001. After several reboots it was taken over in 2010 by Alexander's Steakhouse.",,,http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/64/10919220/3/,David Paul Morris / The Chronicle,Chez Nous in San Francisco
2001,Aziza,"Given the economic downturn, 2001 was a tough year for restaurants. Six restaurants I reviewed during the year didn't make it to the 2002 New Year's toast. Yet the year marked an auspicious debut for this Moroccan restaurant. Mourad Lahlou, who had no formal training, followed up his more traditional Kasbah with this Richmond District restaurant. As he became more confident he began to experiment with traditional recipes, becoming one of the first chefs to interpret his native cuisine from the perspective of his adopted homeland. The restaurant is now undergoing a remodel. Lahlou is also the owner of the celebrated Mourad, which opened last year.",Dry Creek Kitchen,"It was big news when Charlie Palmer of New York's Aureole moved to Healdsburg and brought a big-city vibe to the sleepy square. It paved the way for other sophisticated restaurants, such as Cyrus.",,,http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/65/10919256/3/,Lea Suzuki / The Chronicle,Aziza in San Francisco
2002,Incanto,"This restaurant opened quietly and didn't start receiving raves until Chris Cosentino came on board a year later. It grew to be one of the most influential restaurants in the city and the temple of whole-animal cookery. Cosentino was one of the first to use under-appreciated animal parts (spaghettini with tuna hearts, parsnips roasted in duck fat, veal breast with kidney and marrow) and was a leader in curing meats. Incanto was an innovator in offering an all-Italian wine list, providing filtered water and adding a service charge to give employees benefits before it was required. The restaurant closed in 2014; Cosentino now owns Cockscomb.",Manresa/Piperade,"David Kinch took a leap of faith when opened Manresa in Los Gatos, a high-end restaurant at a time when the economy was still in recovery. He was one of the first to pair up with a single farm, which both inspired and informed his menu. He's also nurtured many chefs that have enhanced the dining scene, including James Syhabout, Jeremy Fox and Belinda Leong. Also in 2002, Gerard Hirigoyen stepped out of his popular Fringale kitchen to open Piperade, which celebrates his Basque heritage. He was one of the first established, classically trained chefs who mustered the courage to follow a passion that wasn't French or Italian, and he was instrumental in starting what's become one of the most exciting trends in California cuisine.",,,http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/65/10919274/3/,Liz Hafalia / The Chronicle,Incanto in San Francisco
2003,Ferry Building Marketplace,"The renaissance of the Ferry Building is one of the most important moments in multi-use restoration in the United States. It had become obsolete; now it is a bustling public marketplace that brings thousands of people to the waterfront. The mission is to showcase the best of our local bounty, with farmers' markets, restaurants and stores such as Acme Bread, Rancho Gordo Beans, McEvoy Olive Oil, Hog Island Oysters, Boulettes Larder, Cowgirl Creamery and many more. The Ferry Building has become a national model that cements the Bay Area's place in the nation's culinary culture.",Quince,"Rebounding from a recession, many talented chefs began to venture out on their own to open small personal restaurants. The seeds of yet another fine dining extravaganza were planted when Michael and Lindsay Tusk opened the Italian-inspired Quince in Pacific Heights. The casually elegant dining room, now home to Octavia, showcased Michael's mastery of pasta. In 2009, they moved to a new location in Jackson Square and opened a much grander version of Quince and, a year later, the more casual Cotogna next door.",,,http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/66/10919299/3/,Kate Wade / The Chronicle,The Ferry Building in San Francisco
2004,A16,"Shelley Lindgren took the Italian road less traveled when she opened A16 and created a Southern Italian restaurant with a focus on Campania, including Neapolitan pizza crafted by Christophe Hille, who at the time was one of the few certified pizzaiolos in the United States. For her part, Lindgren introduced wines from small producers, making a visit there a seminar in Southern Italian wines. Hille also introduced ‚Äúmeatball Mondays‚Äù which were so popular that meatballs became ‚Äî and remain ‚Äî a staple of Northern California menus.",,,,,http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/66/10919315/3/,Kim Komenich / The Chronicle,A16 in San Francisco
2005,Pizza,"The 2005 pizza boom says a lot about the continual casualization of our dining experience. Scores of gourmet restaurants were offering pizza before this ‚Äî the Caf√© at Chez Panisse, Wolfgang Puck‚Äôs Spago ‚Äî but in 2005 three high-profile Bay Area chefs dove for the dough. In San Francisco, Craig Stoll opened Pizzeria Delfina in the storefront beside his main restaurant; in Larkspur, Bruce Hill did the same with Pizzeria Picco; and in Oakland, Charlie Hallowell left the Chez Panisse womb to open Pizzaiolo.",Canteen,"After a high-profile turn as chef at Rubicon, Dennis Leary took a step back and opened this tiny restaurant on Sutter Street. With only 20 seats, including seven at the counter, he handled the business with only an assistant, dishwasher and waiter. He was at the forefront of the trend of exceptionally talented chefs who forego the traditional grand surroundings to cook in a more casual enviroment.",,,http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/66/10919354/3/,Chris Hardy / The Chronicle,"Pizza with wild nettles and pecorino from Chez Panisse CafÈ, the progenitor of the California pizza craze."
2006,Coi,"Daniel Patterson became the face of foraging soon after he opened this high-style restaurant within the shadows of Broadway's neon glitter. Early on, he concentrated on the importance of aroma in stimulating the palate and food memories and even wrote a book about the subject. He made oils out of local redwoods, headed to the coast to find local seaweed and foraged for other wild ingredients. Without declaring so, his menus were mostly vegetable-centric, but the combinations and presentations were so good most people didn't even notice, or care.",Nopa,"The opening of Nopa shows how one restaurant can define a neighborhood. Located in a former bank building at Divisadero and Hayes, this California-inspired restaurant made the decision to open late and became the gathering place for the restaurant industry.",,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/67/10919365/3/,Kim Komenich / The Chronicle,Coi in San Francisco
2007,Ubuntu,"Not since Greens opened in 1979 has a vegetarian restaurant had more impact on the restaurant scene. Sandy Lawrence turned the downstairs of her Napa yoga studio into a dining room, and patrons could often see students bending and stretching behind a translucent wall overlooking the stylish room. While the idea of health and clean living was a guiding principle, it was the cooking of Jeremy Fox that created a national sensation. It didn't matter that it was socially conscious; the food was legions above what anyone else was doing. When he left, Aaron London took his place. London is now the owner of the lauded Al's Place in the Mission, which, while not vegetarian, has moved meat off the center of the plate. Fox moved to Los Angeles and now cooks at Rustic Canyon, solidifying his reputation as a great cook.",,,,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/67/10919377/3/,Laura Morton / The Chronicle,Ubuntu in Napa
2008,Camino,"Alice Waters has groomed many cooks who have gone on to great things, but Russell Moore offered something special at Camino, the Oakland restaurant that he opened with his wife, Allison Hopelain. Moore worked at Chez Panisse for more than 20 years and has become one of the most pure and accomplished practitioners of fireside cooking. Most items on the compact menu have been cooked over, in or around fire. Camino also took the artisan cocktail movement to a new level by disallowing any product behind the bar that couldn't be traced back to its origin.",Beretta,"The pizza and cocktail cultures merged at this Mission restaurant, where, initially, a rotating cadre of the city's best bartenders spent a week behind the bar and where Ruggero Gadaldi crafted thin-crusted pies and Italian comfort food.",,,http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/67/10919387/3/,Katy Raddatz / The Chronicle,Camino in Oakland
2009,Nopalito,"Laurence Jossel was so impressed by the family meals cooked by two of his workers, Gonzalo Guzman and Jose Ramos, he wanted to give them their own platform, and in so doing he set the stage for a boom of high-quality Mexican restaurants. Nopalito uses the same exacting standards Jossel employs at his groundbreaking Nopa, even going as far as grinding organic corn for masa. Products are pristine, prices are reasonable and the restaurant sets standards for Mexican food that other chefs try to emulate. Ramos left the restaurant a few years ago, but Guzman continues to turn out great posole, enchiladas mole and carnitas.",Saison,"In 2009, Joshua Skenes started Saison as a pop-up several nights a week in a converted Mission barn, offering a seven-course fixed price menu. His following continued to increase, and, in 2013, he moved into a permanent SoMa space. Saison's narrative showcases the conversion of pop-ups to permanent, the renewed popularity of fixed price menus (which seemed to be on deathwatch a decade earlier), and the return to cooking over a fire, matched with an unparalleled refinement.",,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/70/10919425/3/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,Nopalito in San Francisco
2010,Benu,"In researching the last 30 years it became abundantly clear that 2010 was the best year of my tenure, with such Bay Area openings as Ippuku, Cotogna, Commonwealth, Wayfare Tavern, Prospect, Morimoto and Oenotri. It was difficult to choose just one that pushed the dining scene ahead more than the others. In the end I chose Benu because Corey Lee had opportunities to open his four-star restaurant just about anywhere ‚Äî but he staked his claim in San Francisco. Benu, which expanded the scope of California cuisine, was instrumental in reinvigorating the city's high-end dining scene.",Bar Agricole,"Owner Thad Vogler believes cocktails should be part of dinner, and no other restaurant went as far in pairing masterful mixologist and exceptional cooking.",Mission Chinese Food,"Anthony Myint and Danny Bowien moved into a shared space with Lung Shan, an old school Chinese American restaurant. Bowien had never cooked Chinese food but wanted to reproduce the specialities he and his friends ate after work and on their nights off. The restaurant represented the intersection of many trends: turning pop ups permanent, creating a different business model, reinterpreting Chinese American food and adding a charity component ‚Äî 75 cents from each main course sold is donated to charity. Bowien also launched Mission Chinese in New York.",http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/70/10919428/3/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,Benu in San Francisco
2011,Bar Terra,"While 2010 was the best year in the last 30, 2011 was among the slowest. It was a year to hunker down, but also a year of reinvention. Hiro Sone and Lissa Doumani divided the space of their decades-old restaurant to create Bar Terra. Sone produces one of the best ramen around as well as other favorites, including fried rock shrimp and the simple but unsurpassed radicchio salad. It was a brilliant way for the duo to compete with all the newer restaurants in Napa Valley, to acknowledge the immense and ever-growing importance of the cocktail culture and to illustrate how an established restaurant can remain relevant.",,,,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/71/10919513/3/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,Bar Terra in St. Helena
2012,State Bird Provisions,"Few if any modern restaurants have had the impact of what Stuart Brioza and Nicole Krasinski did at State Bird. The restaurant employs a modernized dim sum service approach, an idea that has been picked up from coast to coast. While they offer a short printed menu, most dishes are wheeled around on carts or hawked by waiters from table to table.",Comal,"While the Mexican food served here is some of the best in the Bay Area and the warehouse-sized space is impressive, it's the noise that created the buzz. Owner John Paluska was the longtime manager of the rock band Phish, and he took heed of one of diners' major complaints and brought in Myer Sound to orchestrate the decibel level, making the entire warehouse space feel like one big noise-canceling headphone. It has helped spark an awareness among other restaurants that they need to consider noise abatement in designs.",,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/71/10919517/3/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,State Bird Provisions in San Francisco
2013,Tosca CafÈ,"Few places in San Francisco have generated as many stories as this North Beach bar. When it looked as if longtime owner Jeanette Etheridge would have to close, two New Yorkers ‚Äî Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield of the Spotted Pig ‚Äî stepped in and spent millions to restore it. They reopened the kitchen, which had been shuttered since 1953 and created a menu of destination-worthy Italian-American comfort food. They proved it's possible to bring a business into the present without destroying what it had been in the past.",Trick Dog,"This bar should be a blueprint for other businesses because it creates a perfect synergy of drinking and dining. The owners, known as the Bon Vivants, completely change the cocktail menu every six months around whimsical themes (Pantone wheel, San Francisco landmarks and, currently, presidential-campaign buttons). The food perfectly suits the mood.",,,http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/44/53/10/9613839/5/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,Tosca CafÈ in San Francisco
2014,Lazy Bear,"More and more young, ambitious chefs are finding new ways to test their concepts. David Barzelay was a Georgetown-educated lawyer with no cooking experience who started his underground restaurant in 2009. When he found a permanent location he retained the same proven format. Dining at his Mission restaurant is like attending a private party. Guests initially go to the mezzanine, where they mingle and enjoy five snacks. Then everyone moves downstairs for the seven-course dinner, served at two tables in front of the open kitchen. Dishes arrive in unison and the chef explains each dish. Tickets are purchased in advance, and they are as hard to get as a hit Broadway show.",Liholiho Yacht Club,"Ravi Kapur was at the top of his profession as the chef at the Prospect, but he gave it up and began hosting pop-ups. When he returned home to Hawaii he got the idea to reinvent his native cuisine. The restaurant has been a runaway success, and Kapur is an inspiration for others to create food that is personal and unique.",,,http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/44/51/64/9608490/5/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,Lazy Bear in San Francisco
2015,Cala,"When Gabriela Camara decided to open a branch of her popular Mexico City restaurant in San Francisco, she knew she would have to give it her all. So she bought a home in the Castro, relocated here and spent several years sourcing ingredients for her seafood restaurant. No other Mexican restaurant in the United States goes to the extent she does to create such items as mussels encased in masa and wrapped in banana leaves and trout tostadas with chipotle, avocado and fried leeks. She also made the decision to employ and train people from Delancey Street and other halfway houses. Great food and a socially conscious attitude is about as San Francisco-centric as you can get.",Al's Place,"Aaron London took a few years off after Ubuntu closed in 2011 and regrouped by bartending and traveling. He opened his restaurant in the Mission with the idea that meat is a side dish, flipping the tried and true formula. His modest 49-seat restaurant captured the city's cultural and social trends, and Al's Place was named the nation's top new restaurant by Bon Appetit magazine in 2015.",,,http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/51/72/10919561/3/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,Cala in San Francisco
2016,In Situ,"There may still be several months left in the year, but it's already clear that Corey Lee's latest concept is a game changer. At the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art he artfully re-creates dishes from top chefs around the world. It's a concept that is not only daring but solidifies the idea that art doesn't just hang from the wall but can also reside on the plate.",,,,,http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/51/01/01/10752107/7/,John Storey / Special to The Chronicle,In Situ in San Francisco
